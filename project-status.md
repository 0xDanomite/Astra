# ASTRA Project Status Report

## Current Implementation Status

### Core Components Implemented

1. **Basic Chat Interface**
- Simple NextJS chat component with message history
- Basic styling following brand guidelines
- Message streaming support
- Loading state handling
Reference: typescript:astra-app/src/components/Chat.tsx

2. **Agent Integration**
- Successfully integrated Coinbase AgentKit
- Basic LangChain integration with GPT-3.5
- Custom message modifier for strategy creation guidance
- Wallet persistence implementation
Reference:

3. **Strategy Creation**
- Basic strategy creation tool implemented
- Support for key parameters:
  - Category selection
  - Token count
  - Rebalance timing
  - Total allocation
- Integration with BASE testnet
Reference:

### Known Issues & Limitations

1. **CoinGecko Integration**
- Rate limiting issues with free API tier
- Excessive API calls during agent retries
- Need to implement better caching strategy
Reference:
```typescript:astra-app/src/lib/services/coingecko.ts
startLine: 15
endLine: 104
```

2. **Strategy Execution**
- Limited to testnet tokens (WETH, USDC)
- Rebalancing scheduler needs optimization
- Error handling needs improvement

3. **Agent Behavior**
- Sometimes provides inconsistent responses
- Need better prompt engineering
- Limited understanding of strategy constraints

## Deviation from PRD

### Implemented Earlier Than Planned
1. Basic strategy execution
2. Wallet persistence
3. Token category support

### Not Yet Implemented
1. Portfolio dashboard
2. Performance tracking
3. Privy wallet integration
4. Real-time updates
5. Transaction monitoring

## Brand Implementation Status

### Implemented
- Basic chat interface structure
- Dark mode support
- Simple loading states

### Pending
- Constellation animations
- Cosmic gradient themes
- Space-themed components
- Advanced UI interactions

## Next Steps Priority

1. **Immediate Fixes Needed**
- Implement robust CoinGecko caching
- Improve agent prompt engineering
- Add better error handling for strategy creation

2. **Short-term Goals**
- Build basic portfolio dashboard
- Implement proper wallet connection
- Add strategy validation
- Improve token selection logic

3. **Technical Debt**
- Refactor strategy executor
- Implement proper testing
- Add proper type safety
- Improve error logging

## Development Notes

### Environment Setup
- Requires CDP API keys
- CoinGecko API key
- OpenAI API key
- BASE testnet configuration

### Local Development
- Next.js app router implementation
- TypeScript for type safety
- Tailwind for styling
- AgentKit + LangChain for AI capabilities

### Testing Environment
- Currently using BASE-Sepolia testnet
- Test wallet data persistence
- Limited to test tokens

## Documentation Needs
1. Setup guide for new developers
2. API documentation
3. Strategy creation flow documentation
4. Testing procedures
5. Deployment guide

This status report reflects the current state as of the latest implementation. Updates should be made as new features are implemented or issues are resolved.
